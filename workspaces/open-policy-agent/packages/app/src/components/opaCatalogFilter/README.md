# Example Catalog Filter

This is an example catalog filter you could use if you are using the [OPA Backend Module Entity Processor](../../../../..//plugins/backstage-plugin-opa-entity-checker-processor/README.md).

You could also totally build your own, this is just an example, for documentation on that, please visit [Customizing Filters in the Backstage Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/catalog-customization/#customize-filters).
